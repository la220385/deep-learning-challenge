# Alphabet Soup Charity Predictor

## Project Background
Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, has historically funded a variety of organizations across the globe. They are looking to streamline the process by utilizing data-driven decision-making to predict the likelihood of an organization's success if funded. This project involves developing a machine learning model, specifically a binary classifier, that predicts whether applicants will successfully utilize the funds, based on data from over 34,000 previous beneficiaries.

## What I've Completed

### Data Preprocessing
- **Identification and Removal of Non-Target Features**: Removed non-informative features such as 'EIN' and 'NAME' to focus the model training on relevant attributes.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical data into numeric format using `pd.get_dummies()` to prepare the dataset for the neural network model.

### Model Development and Evaluation
- **Neural Network Design**: Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify potential beneficiaries as successful or not.
- **Model Optimization**: Implemented strategies such as adjusting the number of neurons and layers, experimenting with activation functions, and using regularization techniques to improve model performance.

## Key Learnings
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Gained insights into designing and tuning neural networks for binary classification tasks.
- **Model Optimization**: Learned various optimization techniques to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Used metrics such as accuracy and loss to evaluate and iterate on model performance.

## Tools and Resources Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, particularly for splitting the dataset and scaling features.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib (Optional)**: For any required data visualization to analyze the model's performance or data characteristics.


## Conclusion
This project has showcased the potential of machine learning in enhancing the decision-making process for nonprofit funding. By accurately predicting funding success, Alphabet Soup can better allocate resources to organizations that are more likely to achieve their objectives, thus maximizing the impact of donations. Moving forward, the project can be expanded by incorporating more complex algorithms, additional features, and real-time data integration to continually improve prediction accuracy and operational efficiency.
